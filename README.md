# Web Scraping Using Python for Faculty Appraisal Project

--This project involves developing a Python-based web scraping tool to extract relevant data for faculty appraisal. The tool collects information such as publications, conference participations, and other professional achievements from university or faculty-related websites. The scraped data is then stored in an SQL database for easy retrieval and analysis.

--The project aims to automate data collection, ensuring accuracy and saving time, while the SQL database facilitates efficient storage, querying, and integration with the appraisal system. This streamlined process helps in generating comprehensive and data-driven faculty performance evaluations.
